Follow this workflow:
1. Verify I've provided old and new file paths
2. smartsearch to check if similar pattern already exists
3. learn_transformation with descriptive pattern name
4. Show me the learned pattern details:
   - Rules extracted
   - Differences identified
   - Transformation logic
5. save_transformation_pattern to persist to Neo4j + Qdrant (when implemented)
6. index_file on both example files
7. Suggest similar files in project where this pattern could apply
