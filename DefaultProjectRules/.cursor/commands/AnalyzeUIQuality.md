name: Analyze UI/CSS Quality

Follow this workflow:
1. analyze_css on target files or directory
2. Show quality scores and specific issues found:
   - Inline styles count
   - Legacy layout patterns (float, table)
   - Missing CSS variables
   - Accessibility issues
   - Duplicate/inefficient rules
3. Prioritize files by worst scores (quality < 7/10 = HIGH priority)
4. Recommend transformation actions for each file
5. Ask if I want to proceed with transformations
