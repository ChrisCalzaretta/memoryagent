# End Session - NOT NEEDED

## ✅ Sessions Don't Need to Be Ended!

**You don't need to manually end sessions.**

The learning system works continuously:
- Sessions are reused across chats in the same workspace
- All interactions are tracked automatically
- Learning persists indefinitely

## Check What's Been Learned

Use `workspace_status` instead:

```
Use MCP tool: workspace_status
- context: "[workspace name]"
```

This shows:
- Active session info
- Q&A pairs stored
- Important files learned
- Tool usage metrics

## When Sessions "End"

Sessions effectively end when:
- You close Cursor (wrapper shuts down)
- You switch to a different workspace

But this is automatic - no action needed!

## The Learning Persists

Even when a session "ends":
- Q&A mappings remain
- File importance scores persist
- Co-edit patterns are saved
- All learning is retained
