Follow this workflow:
1. list_transformation_patterns to show available patterns
2. Let me select which pattern to apply (or search_transformation_patterns if implemented)
3. apply_transformation with selected patternId and target file
4. Show me the transformation result and changes made
5. analyze_css to verify quality (if CSS was transformed)
6. index_file on transformed files
7. Write integration tests for changes
8. validate_best_practices
