Manage TODO items. Actions: 'add', 'search', 'update_status'.

#### `query_similar_tasks`
Query similar successful tasks for guidance on how to approach a new task.

#### `query_task_lessons`
Query lessons learned from similar failed tasks. Returns what to avoid and what approaches to try.

#### `store_successful_task`
Store a successful task approach for future learning. Saved to both context-specific and shared collections.

#### `store_task_failure`
Store detailed information about a failed task for future learning. Includes what failed, why, and approaches tried.
